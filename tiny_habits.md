# Atomic Habits - Reflection

## Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea I got to know is that how a tiny habit can actually convert my habits into bigger things. It will give me a lot of benefits in the future.

## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

**B** stands for Behavior.  
**M** stands for Motivation.  
**A** stands for Ability.  
**P** stands for Prompt.

### How to Use B = MAP to Build New Habits:
1. **Pick a Tiny Habit**  
2. **Anchor It to an Existing Habit (Prompt)**  
3. **Make It Easy (Ability)**  
4. **Celebrate Your Success**

## Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

A positive action gives us good motivations, and to change, you need a good mindset. So that's why it is important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of the habit.

## Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea from James Clear’s talk was the story of the British cycling team. They were underperforming until Dave Brailsford, their performance director, introduced the concept of "the aggregation of marginal gains." By improving everything by just 1%—from training to small details like handwashing—they achieved remarkable success. This story highlighted how small, consistent improvements can lead to extraordinary results over time, reinforcing the power of incremental progress.

## Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear emphasizes that identity is key to building lasting habits. Instead of focusing on goals, he suggests focusing on who you want to become. For example, instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am a runner." Small actions that align with your desired identity gradually reinforce it, and when you change your identity, your behaviors follow naturally.

## Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear advises making habits easier by reducing friction. Simplify the process, decrease the effort required, and make the habit more convenient to start. For example, lay out workout clothes the night before to make exercising easier the next day.

## Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear suggests making habits harder by increasing friction. Make the undesirable habit more difficult to start by adding obstacles. For example, if you want to stop snacking, store unhealthy foods out of sight or remove them from your home entirely.

## Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I’d like to read more. To make the cue obvious, I’ll leave books on my desk. To make it attractive, I’ll pick books I enjoy. To make it easier, I’ll start with 10 minutes a day. To make it satisfying, I’ll track my progress and reward myself after each reading session.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I’d like to eliminate excessive social media use. To make the cue invisible, I’ll turn off notifications and move apps to the last page of my phone. To make it unattractive, I’ll unfollow accounts that don’t add value. To make it harder, I’ll set screen time limits. To make the response unsatisfying, I’ll delete apps during certain hours.
