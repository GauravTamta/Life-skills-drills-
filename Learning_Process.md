# Learning Process

_"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."_ - Albert Einstein

## Question 1 - What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a learning process that involves explaining concepts in simple terms to identify weak spots in understanding and refine knowledge.

Steps:

- **Choose a Topic**
- **Explain it Simply**
- **Find Weak Spots**
- **Refine and Simplify**

## Question 2 - Most Interesting Idea from the Video

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method:

1. **Set a Timer for 25 Minutes**: Focus on the task.
2. **Take a 5-Minute Break**: Relax after each session.
3. **Repeat**: Four 25-minute cycles, followed by a longer break.

Helps maintain focus and energy.

## Question 3 - Active and Diffused Modes of Thinking

1. **Active Mode**: Focused, detail-oriented thinking.  
   _Example_: Writing an essay with full attention to structure and word choice.

2. **Diffused Mode**: Relaxed, creative thinking.  
   _Example_: Taking a break after writing the essay, leading to new ideas and improvements.

Both modes complement each other for effective learning.

## Question 4 - Steps to Approach a New Topic:

1. Deconstruct the skill
2. Learn enough to self-correct
3. Remove practice barriers
4. Practice at least 20 hours

## Question 5 - Actions to Improve Learning:

1. **Apply the Feynman Technique**: Simplify and clarify concepts.
2. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Break study sessions into focused intervals.
3. **Follow Steps for Approaching a New Topic**: Break topics into sections, review regularly.
