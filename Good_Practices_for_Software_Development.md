# Question 1

**Which point(s) were new to you?**

Build strong connections with your teammates by learning about the company, the product, and their roles. Join meetings a bit early to chat informally and understand their schedules to plan calls when they're available.

# Question 2

**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

Always over-communicate. If requirements change and deadlines shift, update your team immediately. Facing issues like no internet, a broken laptop, or unexpected delays in implementation? Let your team know. Use group chats or channels instead of private messages to keep everyone informed. Never miss calls—if you can’t talk, answer and let them know you’ll call back in 5-10 minutes. It’s better than leaving it as a missed call.
